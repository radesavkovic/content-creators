    },
    {
        "q": "Can I take my initial BUSD back?",
        "a": "Over Time! Cats are not bought, Cats are mined therefore they can't be sold. Once cats are mined they work for you indefinitely, providing you with an unlimited amount of BUSD at a starting rate of 8% daily."

        "a": "Cats are sustained by continued community support, just as every other crypto coin, token or project. The difference is that since there is no token, there is no price to dump. As long as cats are mining in the contract, there will be rewards!"

        "q": "Is it better to Compound or Harvest?",

When a new user hires miners after clicking your personal referral link, the contract will send a BUSD value equal to 12% instantly to your Lucky Cats. Be smart, use it to buy cats and build yourself a stream of income."
